# Architecture Guide

## Project Architecture Overview

This Unity project follows industry-standard architectural patterns for scalability and maintainability.

## Core Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Business Logic**: Isolated from Unity-specific code
- **Data Layer**: Separate from presentation logic
- **Network Layer**: Abstracted through interfaces

### 2. Dependency Injection
- **Service Locator Pattern**: For global services
- **Interface-based Design**: Loose coupling between systems
- **Testable Architecture**: Easy unit testing

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Publisher-Subscriber Pattern**: Decoupled communication
- **Unity Events**: UI and gameplay interactions
- **Custom Event System**: Cross-system messaging

## System Overview

### Core Systems
```
GameManager
├── SceneManager
├── SaveSystem
├── AudioManager
├── InputManager
└── UIManager

NetworkManager
├── PocketBaseClient
├── RealtimeSync
├── AuthenticationService
└── DataSync
```

### Data Flow
1. **Input Layer**: Captures user input
2. **Business Logic**: Processes game rules
3. **Data Layer**: Manages state and persistence
4. **Presentation Layer**: Updates UI and visuals
5. **Network Layer**: Synchronizes with server

## Design Patterns Used

- **Singleton**: Game managers and services
- **Observer**: Event system
- **Factory**: Object creation
- **Strategy**: Different game modes
- **Command**: Input handling and undo systems

## Performance Considerations

- **Object Pooling**: For frequently instantiated objects
- **LOD Systems**: For complex 3D models
- **Async Operations**: For network calls
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal patterns
